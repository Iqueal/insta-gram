# Beyond The [sample](https://bp-insta-clone.netlify.app/) :

Various important things which were missing in the sample that I added are as:

1. __Navigate back to homepage__ : There is no way to go back to homepage if you are inside of any [post in the sample](https://bp-insta-clone.netlify.app/comments/BAcJeJrQca9) but in my app you can navigate back to home from the [post page](https://instaz.vercel.app/comments/BAcJeJrQca9) by clicking on the instagram logo at the top of the [post page](https://instaz.vercel.app/comments/BAcJeJrQca9).

2. __Update comment count__ : In the [post page](https://bp-insta-clone.netlify.app/comments/BAcJeJrQca9) of the sample app if we comment the number of comments below the post remains the same. But in my app when ever a user comments on a [post](https://instaz.vercel.app/comments/BAcJeJrQca9), the number of comment updates by 1 after each comment.

3. __Functional comment button__ : In the sample [post page](https://bp-insta-clone.netlify.app/comments/BAcJeJrQca9) the comment button under the post does nothing, but in [my app](https://instaz.vercel.app/comments/BAcJeJrQca9) the comment button is fully functional, if a user clicks on the comment button the keyboard is shown *(in touch screen devices)* or the comment input field gets focused *(in non touch screen devices)* hence making use of that comment button.

4. __404 error page__ : If a user visits the route which is unavaliable in the sample app, the error page from netlify gets trigged with does not look good, but in my app a very attractive page is shown, with a link to home page, to preview that error page [click here](https://instaz.vercel.app/preview-error-page).
